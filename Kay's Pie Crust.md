# Kay's Pie Crust
## Ingredients
- 16 oz lard (room temperature)
- 6 cup flour

ch as a plastic ice cream tub).

On baking day, take out however much of the mixture you need with a fork
(important!). Slowly drizzle cold water into the mixture until desired
consistency. Roll it out flat with a rolling pin, then lightly dust both sides
with flour. Use as desired.

Note: if it's too dry, it will break apart.
